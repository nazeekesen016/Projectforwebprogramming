# Projectforwebprogramming
For Web final project I created a dynamic web application. This application is pretty simple created and at the same time it is a cool, full web application.
Why do you use this site for?
This web site shows you a time: hour: minutes: seconds.
In a background a set a photo, it will change by itself depend on time. Not only icture will change also a text on this web site. For example in the morning it shows "Good Morning" ....... (will show a name that you wrote). Afternoon it will show "Good Day" and in the Evening it will show "Good Evening".

You can use this web application in different ways. 

First way you can keep track on time. 
Second way you can use as a planner.
Third way you can use as a To-Do List.

In this web application set a local storage, so it will remember a name an a goal of your day and will keep it till you will change it.
As I have mentioned before you can use it as a To-Do List, because it will show your goal of the day and when you open a website it will be a reminder for you. And it works like a planner to.

For this application were used JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

On the background were set pictures of International Alatoo University. (There were added 3 photos)
